DISCO:
- Creating an (Integer) Array:
    - ArrayList <Integer> arrList = new ArrayList<>();
- ArrayLists cannot be set to a specific size when initally created.

- add(int i, Object o) inserts o at index i.
- add(Object o) adds o to the end of the list.
- remove(int i) removes the elment at index i.
- get(int i) returns the element at index i.
- set(int i, Object o) replaces the element at index i with o.
- size() returns the number of elements in the list.

- add, get, remove, and set are built-in functions of ArrayList.
- Once an ArrayList is initialized, elements can be added to it indefinitely and it automatically resizes itself.
- Unlike length of an array that returns the number of slots set aside in the array, size() returns the number of elements in an ArrayList.

QCC:
- Should we also include a functionality to sort the ArrayList, if it is not already in increasing order?
- Why is the only default size for an ArrayList 0, i.e. why can't we set an initial size to an ArrayList?
- What would be functionality if we wanted to add a method that would remove items in an increasing order?
